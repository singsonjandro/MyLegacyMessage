        <strong>Mark Cecil</strong> lost his dad to <strong>dementia</strong> in 2021.
        He started the <strong>Remembering Them podcast</strong> with a friend to share stories of loss
        and speak with guests about their experiences, offering comfort to others while raising
        awareness of different illnesses. Mark wishes he had recorded his dadâ€™s stories before his
        memory fadedâ€”something to preserve for his children and future generations. From this
        realisation, <strong>My Legacy Message</strong> was born.
